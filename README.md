_____________________________________________________________

## Project Description
Plants is the studing task: I made the landing page of a site that offers its services for growing plants 
in the garden and caring for them, making it adaptive and interactive.

## Key skills:
- valid semantic adaptive layout
- easy to maintain readable code
- export styles and graphics from Figma
- using JavaScript to implement the functionality specified in the task

## The project consists of the following blocks 
(valid semantic layout. The landing matches the layout):

- header
- section welcome
- section about 
- section service 
- section prices
- section contacts 
- footer

The project is available for viewing in any browser, it has a web, 768px (tablet) и 380рх (mobile) 
versions (screen width ≥ 320px there is not  horizontal scrollbars is limited whil
maintaining the entire contents of the cells.). 
Also I made burger menu for a smaller scrins.

When you click on the buttons: Gardens, Lawn, Planting, the focus changes to services in the service section.
Accordion in the prices section includes 3 dropdown lists about services and prices.
In the contacts section, implement a select with a choice of cities. Depending on the user's choice, 
a block appears with the address and phone number of the office in a particular city.
